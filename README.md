## Latest Updates
- I was having trouble getting all of the prime data since the "primes" tab in ZP only receives data from the top 10 fastest time on each lap, and if there are a lot of unregistered riders in the top 10, that would sometimes leave less than 10 registered riders with data for their times.
- I was able to find full result data under the "Sprints and KOMs" tab - so I re-wrote the algorithm that calculates prime results and got it working perfectly for stage 2!
- Problem is that "Sprints and KOMs" tab and the data that comes with it doesn't seem to exist for every race, and stage 1 doesn't have it. So now I have no way to calculate prime data for stage 1 - unless I add the old algorithm back in. I'll do it, but it will only give me partial results. I'm not sure if ZP is having issues or of Chris  got the prime data for stage 1 a different way.


A Python script that could help automate the process of calculating results for Team Vegan's Veganuary Race League

Clone this repo and then you can:

run the script - open terminal (for mac) and type
```
python3 get_results.py
```

You should see something like:
```
resolving stage results for cat A
resolving stage results for cat B
resolving stage results for cat C
resolving stage results for cat D
resolving prime results for cat A
resolving prime results for cat B
resolving prime results for cat C
resolving prime results for cat D

```

## Stage Results
You can view the results in the above `results` directory

Running the `get results.py` script will process the data stored in the `zp_data` directory compare it to our registration data in the `veganuary_data` directory (currently only for stages 1 and 2) and produce results stored in the `results` directory. Stage results are broken down by category, while prime results are broken down by the prime name and category (i.e. `veganuary_prime_results_c_Marina_Sprint.csv`. At first glance they appear to be accurate, but I haven't combed through them super thoroughly so let me know if you see any errors!

Prime results have the womens results at the end (identified by the gender column having a value of 2)

## Overall Standings
I have input the latest data as CSVs in the `veganuary_data/standings` directory.

Next:
- Use the current overall standings and the stage results to calculate new overall standings

# Getting Results After a New Stage
## Get Stage Data From ZwiftPower
- To get the results data, open the chrome dev tools inspector (right click, inspect), go to the network tab and search for a network request ending in `_zwift.json` (something like `1471415_zwift.json?_=1610371372960`). Right click on that request and click `copy response`
- Create a new file under the `zp_data/stage_n` directory (you will have to create this directory) and name it `stage_n_results.py`
- Create a new variable and paste the copied data into a multiline string:
  ```
  STAGE_4_RESULTS = '''pasted data goes here'''
  ```
- Go back to ZwiftPower and go to the primes tab, select a category and select "fastest time"
- Look in the networks tab for a network request that should be something like `api3.php?do=event_primes...` and copy the data from that request.
- Create a new file and variable for that data as well, something like `STAGE_2_PRIME_DATA_C`
## Create a New Results Directory
- Add a new directory in the `results` folder and name it `stage_n` (replace `n` with the stage number)
## Modify the get_results.py file
- Import your result data into `get_results.py` like this:
  ```
  # import stage 1 data
  from zp_data.stage_1.stage_1_results import STAGE_1_RESULTS
  from zp_data.stage_1.stage_1_prime_a import STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_A
  from zp_data.stage_1.stage_1_prime_b import STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_B
  from zp_data.stage_1.stage_1_prime_c import STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_C
  from zp_data.stage_1.stage_1_prime_d import STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_D
  ```
- Instantiate a new `StageResultsModel` with your stage results:
  ```
  # Run script for stage 1
  stage_1_model = StageResultsModel(STAGE_1_RESULTS)
  ```
- Call the `get_veganuary_stage_results()` with the following arguments and print a statement:
  - category
  - stage_number
  ```
  # stage results by cat
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_stage_results("a", 1)
  print("resolving stage results for cat A")
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_stage_results("b", 1)
  print("resolving stage results for cat B")
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_stage_results("c", 1)
  print("resolving stage results for cat C")
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_stage_results("d", 1)
  print("resolving stage results for cat D")
  ```
- Call the `get_veganuary_prime_results()` method with the following arguments and print a statement:
  - prime_data
  - category
  - stage_number
  ```
  # prime results by cat
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_prime_results(STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_A, "a", 1)
  print("resolving prime results for cat A")
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_prime_results(STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_B, "b", 1)
  print("resolving prime results for cat B")
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_prime_results(STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_C, "c", 1)
  print("resolving prime results for cat C")
  stage_1_model.get_veganuary_prime_results(STAGE_1_PRIME_DATA_D, "d", 1)
  print("resolving prime results for cat D")
  ```
## Run the Script
- Run the script and check that results were populated in your new stage directory under the `results` directory.
